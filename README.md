# Overwatch Player Profile Web Scraper

This script is a web scraper that scrape Overwatch player profile pages for game statistic data. I created this script because Blizzard does not provide a Web API for their player game statistics, and all other profile web scrapers I came across didn't work properly. This can be zipped and tossed in a AWS Lambda function paired with API Gateway to make this a quick and cheap Web API.
